## Mission-to-Mars

This is not the first time I'm familiar with web scrapping, the objective of this challenge was not only to gather data with this new method but also to present it in a readable way so others can be aware of the latest tendencies about Mars (in this case).

Particularly, I found very challenging this assignment due to all the different tools we use to make this run. From Pandas to Bootstrap, from dataframes to html. It is amazing how there's a whole toolkit waiting to be used in the Data World. 

As we entered this module I started to understand how developers and data scientists don't have to build everything from scratch, how the concept of libraries save a lot of work and time. Bootstrap is a great example and it opens a whole world of posibilities.
